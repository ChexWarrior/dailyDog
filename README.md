# Daily Dog :dog: :dog2: :poodle:

## Description
This extension adds a new page action which when clicked will reveal a cute picture of a random dog.

This extension proudly uses [Dog CEO's Dog API ](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) for it's images.


## Why?
I'm creating this to learn about web-extensions and just to have something to hack away on when I'm not coding for work or school.

**NOTE: This extension is not yet complete!**
