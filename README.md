# Daily Dog :dog: :dog2: :poodle:

## Description
Daily Dog is an extension that inserts pictures of dogs into your web page at random intervals.  

This extension proudly uses [Dog CEO's Dog API ](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) for it's images.


## Why?
I'm creating this to learn about web-extensions and just to have something to hack away on when I'm not coding for work or school.

**NOTE: This extension is not yet complete!**
